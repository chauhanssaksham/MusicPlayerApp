TODO:
    1. Implement the "songs.js" file on a database.            

Thoughts:
    Implement already made Music Player First, then add Layouts.
        When implementing layouts: Put 
                                        "app.set('layout extractStyles', true);"
                                            and
                                        "app.set('layout extractScripts', true);"
                                            in index.js
                                    and
                                        Follow step 17 of Notes to set up Partials and Layouts
